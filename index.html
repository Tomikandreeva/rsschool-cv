            <p>

              huge volume of communication between the team and with clients as

                  My way in this company started with a big volume of education.
                  It is an unknown sphere in Uzbekistan and I was compelled to
                  start from zero levels of knowledge. After a couple of months
                  of my work, I received the first grade and started to work
                  with more independence. From the six months, I received a
                  second grade and some later - position of Supervisor
                  Assistant. The company works by NY time and people in Tashkent
                  works in two shifts: night shift (like call center) and
                  Supervisor must be there if someone from clients wants to
                  speak with him and day shift - all work organization and staff
                  coordination presented by Supervisor Assistance. So I
                  organized work responsibilities and time for all-day shift
                  employees in our department, also the education of new
                  employees is my responsibilities till this days. In the second
                  year of my work, I received the third grade. Last year I
                  decided to try a new experience and became a QA specialist - I
                  check the quality of work of our employees, help them with
                  something new or unknown.
