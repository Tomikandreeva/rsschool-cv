            My way in this company started with big volume of education. It is a
            unknown sphere in Uzbekistan and I was compelled to start from zero
            level of knowledge. After couple month of my work I received first
            grade and started to work with more independency. From the six month
            I received second grade and some later - position of Supervisor
            Assistant. Company works by NY time and people in Tashkent works in
            two shifts: night shift (like call center) and Supervisor must be
            there if someone from clients wants to speak with him and day shift
            - all work organization and staff coordination presented by
            Supervisor Assistance. So I organized work responsibilities and time
            for all day shift employees in our department, also education of new
            employees is my responsibilities till this days. On the second year
            of my work I received third grade. Last years I decided to try new
            experience and became QA specialist - I check quality of work of our
            employees, help them with something new or unknown.
