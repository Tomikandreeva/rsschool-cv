                My way in this company started with big volume of education. It
                is a unknown sphere in Uzbekistan and I was compelled to start
                from zero level of knowledge. After couple month of my work I
                received first grade and started to work with more independency.
                From the six month I received second grade and some later -
                position of Supervisor Assistant. Company works by NY time and
                people in Tashkent works in two shifts: night shift (like call
                center) and Supervisor must be there if someone from clients
                wants to speak with him and day shift - all work organization
                and staff coordination presented by Supervisor Assistance. So I
                organized work responsibilities and time for all day shift
                employees in our department, also education of new employees is
                my responsibilities till this days. On the second year of my
                work I received third grade. Last years I decided to try new
                experience and became QA specialist - I check quality of work of
                our employees, help them with something new or unknown.
